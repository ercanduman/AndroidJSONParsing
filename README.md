Android JSON Parsing github example

This an Android application with JSON parsing codes.

The url I have used is : http://horoscope-api.herokuapp.com/horoscope/month/libra

The application check internet connection as well. If there is no connection it shows some TOAST message such as:

If there is internet connection;

the application show a dialog while parsing data from the internet (Loading, please wait...)
when finished it shows all data in three different Textviews (title, date, details)
